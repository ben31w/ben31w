Ben Wright — @ben31w

# Summary
- Software Engineer at L3Harris Technologies
- Christopher Newport University, Class of 2023, Computer Science major
- Started programming in high school. Inspired to pursue a CS degree due to a teacher's encouragement, the satisfaction I get from programming, and the clout of being a software engineer.
- For fun, I enjoy bodybuilding, most forms of exercise, and being around cool people. Sometimes I code for fun. But mostly I've coded for work and school. I enjoy programming, but I think it's important to avoid burnout.
