Ben Wright — @ben31w

Christopher Newport University, class of 2024. Pursuing a major in computer science and a career as a software developer.

I’m currently taking courses on data structures and algortihm analysis. 
In my spare time, I'm working on becoming an Oracle Certified Associate for Java SE 8.
Being an associate is only the first step in my plan to become a Certified Professional (you got to start somewhere I guess).
I'm also working on learning HTML and CSS.
