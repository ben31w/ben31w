Ben Wright — @ben31w

# Summary
- Software Engineer at L3Harris Technologies
- Christopher Newport University, Class of 2023, Computer Science major
- Started programming in a high school CS class. I was inspired to pursue a CS degree due to my high school teacher's recommendation, the satisfaction I get from using computers to solve problems, and the clout of being a software engineer.
- Came into the college with the goal of having a software engineering job upon graduation. By perfecting my personal projects, learning as much about CS as I could, and habitually applying to internships, I achieved this goal.
- One reason I enjoy CS and software engineering is it gives me chances to learn new skills.

# Skills
- Java, Python, C++, C#, SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Linux
- Git
- Agile development
