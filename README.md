Ben Wright — @ben31w

# Summary
- Christopher Newport University, computer science major, graduating December 2023
- Software Engineering Intern at L3Harris Technologies
- Started programming in a high school CS class. I was inspired to pursue a CS degree due to my high school teacher's recommendation, the satisfaction I get from using computers to solve problems, and the clout of being a software engineer.

# Skills
- High proficiency with OOP, most notably Java and Python, with some experience in C++ and C#. Most of my personal projects are in Java or Python.
- Moderate proficiency with Git, with growing exposure to branching and merging in multi-user environments.
- Hoping to become more proficient at anything software engineering-related. Some avenues that interest me the most are database management with SQL and Linux/shell scripting.
