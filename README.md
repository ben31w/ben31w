Ben Wright — @ben31w

I'm not very active with uploading my personal projects on GitHub at this time. I'm in more of a "learning phase" right now. 
The emphasis for me has been learning new concepts (ex: computer networking). 
I've coded small programs to accomplish personal goals, but I've yet to organize them into projects worthy of pushing to GitHub.
I promise to return to GitHub one day...
